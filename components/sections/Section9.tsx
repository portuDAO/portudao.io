            Users would be able to trade their assets whenever they wanted with
            a sufficient amount of liquidity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Liquidity provision is made simple in Portuswap.
            <br />
            <br />
            Users can always deposit and withdraw tokens of the same kind
            without worrying about the pool compositions or size, or even the
            difference between token and LP token.
